# Mixed Effects Regression Sales

This project is part of the final evaluation of my Statistics in Action course at Polytechnique.

We were to conduct a series of linear and non linear mixed effects models on sales data. 
We were to pay attention in particular to the parameters that allowed convergence of non linear regression methods. 

Benchmarking models was done using relevant information criterions on which critical thinking was expected.
